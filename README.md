### Distributed Seat Locking & Seat Booking Checkout

Shows the interaction between distributed seat locking (Redis `SETNX`), optimistic version control in Hibernate, and the asynchronous ticket queueing workflow.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Client
    participant SC as SeatLockController
    participant BC as BookingController
    participant RD as Redis
    participant MQ as RabbitMQ
    participant Consumer as BookingConsumer
    participant BS as BookingService
    participant ES as EventService
    participant DB as MySQL DB

    %% 1. Seat Selection
    Client->>SC: POST /api/seats/42/lock (seatId: "A1")
    SC->>RD: SETNX seat_lock:42:A1 userId (EX 5m)
    alt Seat already held
        RD-->>SC: 0 (failed)
        SC-->>Client: HTTP 409 Conflict (Already Held)
    else Seat free
        RD-->>SC: 1 (success)
        SC->>Client: HTTP 200 OK (Locked for 5m)
        SC->>Client: Broadcast list of locked seats via WS topic
    end

    %% 2. Checkout Initiated
    Client->>BC: POST /api/bookings {eventId: 42, seats: ["A1"]}
    Note over BC: Check Rate Limits in Redis (max 500 req/min)
    BC->>RD: SET booking_status:<corrId> PENDING
    BC->>MQ: Publish BookingMessage
    BC-->>Client: HTTP 202 Accepted {bookingId: corrId}

    %% 3. Async Processing
    MQ->>Consumer: Deliver BookingMessage
    Consumer->>BS: Call bookTickets(email, req)
    
    %% Concurrency control on event write
    loop Attempt event lock
        BS->>RD: SETNX lock:event:42 uniqueValue (EX 10s)
        alt Lock acquired

            BS->>BS: attemptBooking()
            BS->>ES: GET /api/events/internal/42 (Retrieve capacity)
            ES-->>BS: Event data
            Note over BS: Verify availableSeats >= ticketCount
            BS->>ES: PUT /api/events/internal/42/deduct-seats
            Note over ES: Decrement availableSeats & check version
            ES->>DB: UPDATE events SET available_seats = ?, version = version+1
            ES-->>BS: Success
            BS->>DB: INSERT INTO bookings (status = CONFIRMED)
            BS->>RD: DEL seat_lock:42:A1 (Release seat lock)
            BS->>RD: DEL lock:event:42 (Release event lock)
            BS->>RD: Set status = COMPLETED, message = "Success"
        else Lock busy
            RD-->>BS: 0 (Failed)
            Note over BS: Backoff and retry (up to 15 times)
        end
    end
```

## 🧠 System Design Decisions

*   **Why Microservices?** A monolithic architecture becomes a bottleneck when the booking engine needs to scale independently of the event discovery catalog. Microservices allow targeted resource scaling.
*   **Why Redis `SETNX` for Locks?** Traditional DB row locks cause massive contention and deadlocks during flash sales. Redis handles hundreds of thousands of atomic lock attempts per second in-memory, acting as a high-speed buffer before database writes.
*   **Why RabbitMQ?** Synchronous PDF generation and email sending block HTTP threads. By dropping messages into RabbitMQ, the Booking Service can respond with `202 Accepted` in milliseconds, improving perceived performance.
*   **Optimistic vs. Pessimistic DB Locking:** Used JPA Optimistic Locking (`@Version`) as a fallback to Redis to maintain DB integrity without the massive performance penalty of Pessimistic locks.

## 🔌 API Documentation (OpenAPI 3)

EventHub features centralized Swagger UI documentation accessible at the API Gateway.

**Unified Swagger UI URL:** `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

### Major Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register` | Register a new user | No |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate and get JWT | No |
| `GET` | `/api/events` | Paginated event catalog (cached) | No |
| `GET` | `/api/events/{id}/recommendations` | Get ML recommendations | No |
| `POST` | `/api/seats/{eventId}/lock` | Atomically lock a seat in Redis | **Yes** (User) |
| `POST` | `/api/bookings` | Queue an async ticket booking | **Yes** (User) |
| `GET` | `/api/bookings/status/{id}` | Poll async booking status | **Yes** (User) |
| `GET` | `/api/bookings/{id}/ticket` | Download generated PDF ticket | **Yes** (User) |
| `POST` | `/api/events` | Create a new event | **Yes** (Admin) |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/analytics/traffic` | Traffic & revenue dashboard | **Yes** (Admin) |

#### Sample Request: Asynchronous Booking
```json
POST /api/bookings
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

{
  "eventId": 42,
  "ticketCount": 2,
  "seats": ["A1", "A2"]
}
```
*Response (202 Accepted):*
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Booking request accepted and queued",
  "data": {
    "bookingId": "c8f2b1a1-9d3c-...",
    "status": "PENDING"
  }
}
```

---

## 🔒 Security

*   **Authentication Mechanism:** Stateless JWT (JSON Web Tokens) verified at the Gateway and Service layers using shared public keys.
*   **Authorization Strategy:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via Spring Security `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`.
*   **Password Handling:** Passwords hashed with BCrypt.
*   **OAuth Integration:** Direct integration with Google OAuth 2.0 OpenID Connect.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Redis-backed token bucket algorithm (e.g., max 500 booking attempts per minute per user).
*   **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Strictly configured at the API Gateway for frontend domains.

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

*   **L2 Caching:** Event catalog queries (`GET /events`) are cached in Redis. Cache eviction triggers automatically on `POST` or `PATCH` to maintain consistency.
*   **Pagination:** All list endpoints use Spring Data `Pageable` to prevent loading massive datasets into memory.
*   **Asynchronous I/O:** PDF generation logic uses `itextpdf` inside a decoupled RabbitMQ listener, keeping HTTP worker threads free.
*   **Query Optimization:** Fetch types configured carefully (`FetchType.LAZY` for `ManyToOne` relations) to prevent the N+1 query problem.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Overview

EventHub is structured to run inside a high-security container network. The layout of the hosting architecture consists of:

*   **AWS Infrastructure**: Hosted on a single **AWS EC2** virtual machine (`t3.small` - 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 30 GB gp3 EBS Volume).
*   **Operating System**: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS.
*   **Elastic IP Address**: Associated with the instance to provide a static public IPv4 gateway.
*   **Containerization**: **Docker Engine** and **Docker Compose v2** manage the deployment environment.
*   **Private Bridge Networking**: All microservices run inside a closed virtual network (`eventhub-net`).
*   **Nginx Proxy Gateway**: The only container exposing ports to the outside world (`80` and `443`). It routes requests to the API Gateway (`gateway-service`), performs Gzip compression, forces rate limits, sets HTTP safety headers, and manages SSL certificates.
*   **Redis (L2 Caching & Concurrency)**: Runs inside the private network. Persistent storage is mounted using Docker volumes (`redis_data`) with `appendonly` AOF tracking.
*   **RabbitMQ Broker**: Decouples heavy processes. Persistent message queues are stored on Docker volume (`rabbitmq_data`).
*   **MySQL Database**: Holds user, ticket, and booking records. Persisted using volume mount (`mysql_data`).

    end
```

### Step 1 — AWS Security Groups Configuration
Create a security group `eventhub-sg` with the following inbound rule configurations:

| Rule Type | Port Range | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| SSH | 22 | Your Local IP only (`x.x.x.x/32`) | Secure server terminal access |
| HTTP | 80 | Anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`, `::/0`) | Standard web traffic access |
| HTTPS | 443 | Anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`, `::/0`) | Secure encrypted web traffic access |

> [!WARNING]
> Keep database ports `3306`, `6379`, `5672`, and service ports `8080-8083` closed to external traffic. They are secured inside the Docker virtual bridge network.

---

### Step 2 — Provision Elastic IP
To ensure the host retains the same IP across updates and resets:
1. Log into the AWS EC2 Console, and head to **Network & Security** → **Elastic IPs**.
2. Click **Allocate Elastic IP address**.
3. Select the allocated address, click **Actions** → **Associate Elastic IP address**.
4. Select the target EC2 instance and click **Associate**.

---

### Step 3 — Install Docker Engine on EC2
Establish an SSH connection to your instance and run the setup scripts:

```bash
# Connect to your instance
ssh -i target-key.pem ubuntu@<YOUR-ELASTIC-IP>

# Update package mappings
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

# Add Docker's official GPG key
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add repository
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Assign permissions to default user (avoids running commands with sudo)
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker
```

---

### Step 4 — Clone Repository and Configure Env Variables
Clone the repo and configure your secrets using the `.env.example` structure:

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Mahesh5f4/event-management-system.git
cd event-management-system/backend

# Create production env file
cp .env.production .env
nano .env
```

Review and set secure keys in the environment file:
```bash
# Database credentials
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=SetSecureDbPassword
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=SetSecureDbPassword

# Messaging broker credentials
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=SetSecureBrokerPassword
SPRING_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=SetSecureBrokerPassword

# Monitoring administration
GF_ADMIN_PASSWORD=SetGrafanaDashboardPassword

# Routing and domain bindings
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

---

### Step 5 — Prepare Target Folders & Build Images
Before running the containers, initialize the local directory paths and build the images:

```bash
# Create local directories for certs and backups
mkdir -p certbot/conf certbot/www backups

# Assign execution permissions to all script files
chmod +x scripts/backup.sh scripts/restore.sh scripts/auto-backup.sh init-letsencrypt.sh

# Build all docker containers from source configurations
docker compose build
```

---

### Step 6 — Run the Stack & Verify Boot Status
Deploy the services in detached mode and trace the logs:

```bash
# Start
docker compose up -d

# Verify all 10 containers are running and healthy
docker compose ps
```

Expected healthy boot order takes ~2 minutes. Verify status values:
```text
eventhub-mysql             -> healthy
eventhub-redis             -> healthy
eventhub-rabbitmq          -> healthy
eventhub-ml-service        -> healthy
eventhub-auth-service      -> healthy
eventhub-event-service     -> healthy
eventhub-booking-service   -> healthy
eventhub-gateway-service   -> healthy
eventhub-nginx             -> healthy
```

---

### Step 7 — SSL Setup (Let's Encrypt)
To enable HTTPS, execute the automated verification script:

```bash
# Run HTTPS initialization script
./init-letsencrypt.sh yourdomain.com your-email@example.com
```

To manage the certificate lifecycle, configure automated renew tasks inside the server's crontab:
```bash
# Open crontab config
crontab -e

# Append renewal task (fires on the 1st of every month)
0 0 1 * * cd /home/ubuntu/event-management-system/backend && docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt -v $(pwd)/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot certbot/certbot:latest renew --quiet && docker compose restart nginx
```

---

### Step 8 — Configure Database Backup Policy
Deploy automated database dumps to protect transaction records:

```bash
# Install cron job mapping (automates DB dumps every night at 2:00 AM)
make setup-backup-cron

# Verify the job mapping is active
crontab -l
```

Manual actions (useful when upgrading containers or running server migrations):
```bash
# Run manual database dump
make backup

# Restore database from dump file
make restore FILE=./backups/eventhub_backup_20260720_120000.sql
```

---

### Step 9 — Deployment Verification Checklist
Execute these commands post-deployment to ensure all systems are operating correctly:

#### Check Infrastructure Services
```bash
# Test MySQL connection
docker exec eventhub-mysql mysqladmin ping -u root --password="$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"

# Test Redis connection
docker exec eventhub-redis redis-cli ping

# Test RabbitMQ connection
docker exec eventhub-rabbitmq rabbitmq-diagnostics check_port_connectivity
```

#### Test API routing and internal services
```bash
# Fetch health check status of Auth microservice through Nginx Gateway
curl -s http://localhost/api/auth/actuator/health

# Verify ML Recommendation service health check response
docker exec eventhub-ml-service python -c \
  "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8001/health').read())"
```

---

### Step 10 — Redeployment & Maintenance
When pushing updates to production, execute a rolling update without dropping active client connections:

```bash
# Pull new changes, build image updates, and hot-restart containers
make update
```

---

## 💻 Running Locally

### Prerequisites
*   Docker & Docker Compose v2
*   Java 17 (JDK) — for running services outside Docker
*   Node.js 20+

There are two ways to run EventHub locally:

---

### Option A — Full Docker Compose (Recommended)

Runs **everything** in containers, exactly as it will on EC2.

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set your SMTP/Google credentials

# 2. Build all images (first run: ~8 minutes)
docker compose build

# 3. Start all 10 services
docker compose up -d

# 4. Check all containers are healthy (~2 minutes)
docker compose ps

# 5. Access the API
# Swagger UI: http://localhost/swagger-ui.html
# API Base:   http://localhost/api/
```

> **Note:** In Docker Compose mode, Nginx listens on port 80. The gateway is not directly accessible.

---

### Option B — Infrastructure in Docker, Services on Host (Faster Dev Cycle)

Runs MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and ML service in Docker; Spring Boot services on your machine for hot-reload.

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure only
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d mysql redis rabbitmq ml-service

# 2. Run all Spring Boot services
.\start-all.bat
# (or run each service individually with: ./mvnw spring-boot:run)

# 3. Access directly via gateway (no Nginx in this mode)
# Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
# API Base:   http://localhost:8080/api/

# 4. Start Frontend
cd ../frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

---

### Common Local Commands

```bash
make status          # Show container health
make logs            # Tail all logs
make logs-booking    # Tail a specific service
docker compose restart auth-service  # Restart one service
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

The codebase maintains an aggregated **~70% Instruction Coverage** (Auth Service: ~91%).
*   **Unit Tests:** JUnit 5 and Mockito verifying core business logic and exception handling without database dependencies.
*   **Integration Tests:** `MockMvc` verifying full controller layers, serialization, and HTTP status codes.
*   **Multi-Module Reporting:** A dedicated `coverage-report` maven module aggregates JaCoCo metrics across all microservices into a single unified HTML report.

**Run Tests:**
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw clean verify
```

---

## 💡 Challenges Solved

**Challenge: The Double Booking Race Condition**
During popular event sales, multiple users attempt to checkout the exact same seat simultaneously. If two threads read the database simultaneously, both see the seat as "available", process payment, and write to the database, resulting in an oversold seat.

**Solution: Multi-Layered Concurrency Control**
1. **Layer 1 (Application):** Distributed Mutex using Redis `SETNX`. The user "locks" the seat for 5 minutes during checkout. Any concurrent request for that seat fails immediately with `409 Conflict` out of memory, never touching the DB.
2. **Layer 2 (Database):** Optimistic Locking (`@Version` annotation). Even if the lock fails or expires unexpectedly, Hibernate checks the entity version during the final `UPDATE`. If another transaction altered it, an `OptimisticLockException` rolls back the transaction entirely.
